Welcome to Memory Game! The main goal of the game is to test your memory. The game features a grid of 16 cards. Your objective is to match pairs of cards with identical pictures before the time runs out. A time limit is imposed, and if the time runs out before you match all the cards, you lose. There's a flip count that keeps track of how many times you've flipped cards.
